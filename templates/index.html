<h4> The TLDR:</h4>

<p>This is an image captioning deep neural network that will name a pet whose image is uploaded to this site via the button below. Details of the implementation, as well as the background for this silly thing, are on the "About" page.</p>

<p>
<b>NB: This network was trained on pictures of animals to produce name-captions. However, it will generate a name <i>no matter what is in the image.</i> If you put a picture of a person in there and it returns a name that is or could be interpreted as racist, sexist, transphobic, etc., you do so without my consent and I take no responsibility for its behavior under these conditions. Future versions of this app will first filter out pictures of humans and then return nothing!</b>
</p>

<p>
With that in mind, please...
